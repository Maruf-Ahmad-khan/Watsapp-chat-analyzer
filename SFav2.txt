25/09/2022, 10:56 - My Name Is Khan: What is the difference between Performance and Competence?

As the two terms are often used in the study and application of human resources, performance and competence help evaluate individuals and their true capabilities. However, several differences between them set them apart.

‚Ä¢ Competence is the ability of an individual to perform one‚Äôs duties or being adequately qualified in order to do so. Performance is an activity or the accomplishment of a given task.

‚Ä¢ Competence involves ‚Äúknowing‚Äù. Performance involves ‚Äúdoing‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ It is difficult to assess competence without evaluating the performance.

25/09/2022, 11:10 - My Name Is Khan: For example
